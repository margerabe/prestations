# Wecasa - Rails technical test

This test is part of the hiring process of Wecasa for a Ruby on Rails backend developer position. The goal of this test is to find a professional for a haircut booking at home.

Don't worry if you don't finish, just go as far as you can ! The program may be a bit ambitious for this time frame.

## About the data.json file

This file contains the data you will need for this test. It has 3 root objects: `prestations` (the prestations a client can book), `pros` (the registered professionals) and `bookings` (a list of bookings to be matched with a professional).

Some attributes of these objects may need an explanation: `prestation#duration` is the duration of the prestation in minutes, `pro#max_kilometers` is the maximum distance (in kilometers) for a professional between its address and a booking address (as the crow flies), `pro#prestations` are the prestations that a pro can handle, `pro#appointments` are the appointments already scheduled in a pro agenda.

## Goal

The goal is to find the available professional(s) for a booking, following the steps below:

1. DB creation : build the appropriate DB and models for the data in `data.json`

2. Write a task to fill the DB with the data from `data.json`

3. Pros selection for a particular booking:

    * select the pros who can handle all the requested prestations

    * select the pros "not too far" (booking location closer than pro max kilometers, as the crow flies)

    * select the pros "open" at the requested appointement (booking timeframe within opening hours)

    * select the pros available at the requested appointement (no scheduled appointment overlapping the requested appointement)

    * select the pros matching all the previous requirements

  The final result may be a function returning for a booking an array of the available professionals' names :

  ```
    ["Nathalie", ...]
  ```

  As much as possible, use database requests to find those professionals.

4. Create a basic booking form (no need for design/UX) and select the available pros after a form submission

## Review

What we'll look at when reviewing your code :

* results (does the code work as expected ?)

* DB schema and models

* code syntax, code style

* naming (are models/functions/variables properly named ?)

* Git history (are commits atomic ? are commit messages clear and useful ?)

* dependencies (are third-party libraries well chosen ?)

What we **won't** look at :

* design and everything front-end related

* documentation (we love doc, but don't waste time on that for this test)

What we **would love** to see :

* one or two tests

* lint tooling

## Requirements

* Your code has to be versioned with Git

* Of course, third party libraries (gem packages) can be used

## Submission

Send us a zip version of your code (with `.git` folder included of course !), or push your project on the Git platform of your choice (Github, Bitbucket, whatever) in a private repo and share this repo with us.
